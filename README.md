## Diabetes Disease Detection using Machine Learning

## Problem statement : 
-We see a lot of shortfall of doctors in India, especially in our time. Many people are suffering without the proper medical checkup. Because of Lockdown and Covid, people need a way to detect whether there is a possibility of obtaining a disease or not, so that people or even doctors may put details of the disease report, and the Model will predict the chances of obtaining a disease, and users may consult doctors as soon as possible. To overcome all of the problems, this app has been designed, which is going to prove its benefits to a great extent.
- To remove the dependence on doctors 
- To provide medical checkups to the poor and helpless 
- Technology should play a larger role in the medical field



## About:
- The website will have an About Page that contains information about diabetes and Web pages regarding diabetes disease. The user will have to input information about his or her diabetes, and the model will predict the results based on that information. Using machine learning, a disease prediction model is developed. 
- The project aims to produce an online health checkup facility to reduce the dependency on doctors, help the poor and the helpless to access health care, and extend the role of technology in the medical field. 
- Machine learning will be used for the Diabetes Disease Detection website, which is an end-to-end website that uses Heroku.
